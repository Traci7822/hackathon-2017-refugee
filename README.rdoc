Asylum Application Generator

Problem: Of the 66 Million displaced in the world, only 23M are signed-up with the UNHCR and of those 23M less than 1% will receive asylum in another country. If asylum is not a likely option for over 65M people, what other options are possible based on their profile? And of those possible options, which options are the best fit (or most likely) for a particular person who is displaced?

Solution: Create a simple form for refugees to enter information about themselves and their families. The form submits the information to a website, which then suggestions which country would be most likely to accept their relocation application.

More Background Info: Some countries including Canada and Australia have sponsorships, and slots for nationalities and profiles open and close at various times. Brazil, for example, may allow some people based on their profile to simply fly there and obtain legal status. Some applicants might be more likely to obtain various types of work visas depending on their occupational history, and others might be able to obtain education visas or scholarships. Some countries may allow payment for monthly or annual travel visas, work visas or other types of visas while other countries may attempt to attract talent with training programs targeting various profiles.
